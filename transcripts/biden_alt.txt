all lost something a collective suffering a collective sacrifice a year fill with the loss of life and the loss of living for all of us but in the loss. we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation reespect and gratitude finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do in fact it may be the most american thing we do and that's what we've done we've seen front line and escentral workers risking their lives sometimes losing them. to save and help others researches and sciences racing for a vaccine and so many of you ad heming way road being strong and all the broken places i know it's been hard i truly now i've told you before i carry a card in my pocket. tat the number of americans who have died on cove to datis on the back of my schedule as of now total deaths

thing to do to save lives sometimes it divides us states pitted against one another instead of working with each other vicious hate crimes against asian ameritcans who ween attacked. harasse blamed and scapegoded at this very moment h so many of them our fellow americans they're on the front lines of this pandemic trina save lives and still still theyreare forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in america it's wrong it's an american and it must. stop look we know what we need to do to beat this fires tell the truth foll the scientist the science work together put trust and faith in our government tofill its most important function which is protecting the american people no function more important we need to remember that government isn't. foreign force in a distant capital no it's us all of us we the people for you and i that america thrives wen we give our hearts wwed we turn our hands to come on purpose and right now my friends we're doing just that. say as you're present iam grateful to you last summer i was in philadelphia and i met a small business honor a woman i asked her i said what do you need most never forget what she said to me she said and looking m mey in the eyes she said i just want the truth the truth just tell me the. think of that my fellow americans you owe nothing less than he truth and for all of you baski when things will get back to normal here is the truth the only way to get our lives back to get our economy back ontrac is to beat the virus you've ben hearin. say that for while i was running and the last fifty days i've been president but this is one of the most complex operations we've undernder undever undertaken as a nation and a long time that's why 'm using every power i have as president of thehe united states to put us on a war footing and get the job done sounds like i perbly that i meang it a war footing. and thank god we're making some real progress now in my first full day in office i outline for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic wehave spent everyday sense attempting to carry it out two months ago the country this country didn't have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or ever near allmera. americanpublic but soon we will we've been working with vaccine manufacturers fiser mdurne johnson and johnson to manufacture and purchase hundrede of millions of doses of these three safe effecti vaccines and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration johnson and johnson. is working together with a competitor murk to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new johnson and johnson vacsen wats one shot in fact just yesterday i announced and i met with the c os of both companies i announced our plan to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and. and vaccines these two companies competitors have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it it's truly a national effort just like we saw during war war too now because all the work we've done we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of. that's months ahead of schedule and we're mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one's arm calling active duty military pima retired doctors and nurses administratuors and  those to administer the shots and we've been creating more places to get the shots. made it possible for you to get a vaccine an nearly one any one of ten thousand farmisies across the country just like you get your flue shot we're a also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly six hundred federally supported vaccination centers that administers hundreds of thousands of shots per day. you can drive up to a statimg or a large parky line get your shot never leave your car and drive home in less than an hourwe've been sending vac seas to hundreds of community health centers all across america located in underserved areas and we've been deploying and we will deploy more mobilevehicles and pop up planks to meet you. where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it we continue to worn on making at home testing available awe been focused on serving people in the hardest it communities of this pandemic black latino native american an rural communities so what does all this add up to e i took office fifty days ago. only eight per cent on americans after months only eight per cent of those over the age of sixty five ha goten their first fac cent cnt to day that numberis sixty five per cent just fourteen per cent of americans over the age of seventy five fifty fifty days ago had gotten their first shot to day that number is. over seventy per cent with new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention the c d c that came out on monday it means simply this millions and millions of grandparentswo went months without being able hug their grand kids can now do co and the more people are fully vaccinated the c d will continue to provide additional guidance. and what you can do in the work place places of worship with your friends as well as travl when i came in the office you may recall i said ta gold ha meno u sad was at kind of way over the top i said i intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office to night i can say were. igoing to meet that goal we're going to beat that goal because we've actually intraced to reach this goal of a hundred lion shots and arms on my sixtieth day in office no other country in the world has done this none i want to talk about the next steps for thinking about first to night i'm announcing that i'll direct all states tribes and territory. to make all adults people eighteen and over eligible to be vaccinated no later than may one let me say that again all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may ne that's much earlier an expected let me be clear that doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately. it means you'd be able to get in line beginning may one every adult will eligl to get their shot and to do this we're going to go from a million shots ta day that i promised in december before i wit sworn in to maintaining beating our current pace of two million shots a day how pacing the rest of the world secondly at. time when every adult is eligible to may we will launch with our partners new tools to make it easier for you to find the vacy and where to get the shop including a new web sihte that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you no more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. thirdly with the passage of the american rescue plan and i thank again the house of senafor passide and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff i  ncluding bus drivers we can accelerate massive nation wide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal that. stated at the same time about a hundred million shots of opening majority of k through eight schools ind my first hundred days in office this is going to be the number one priority of my new secretary of education maguel cardona four in the coming weeks we will issue further guidance. on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated to lessen the confusion to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinatd and finally fifft and may be most importantly i promise i will do everything in my power i will not relent until we beat this fires but i need you. the american people i need you i need every america to do te part that's not i perbly i ned you i need you to get vactinated when it's your turn when you can find an oppor tunity and to help your family your friends your neighbors  get vaccinated as well because here's the point if we do all this if we. our part if we do this together bhy july  the fourth there's a good chance you yor families and friends we'll be able to get together in your back yard or in your neighbourhood and have a  cook outan a barbicu and celebrate independence day that doesn't mean large events with lots of people together but it does mean small groups we'll be able to get together after this long hard. here that will make this independence day something truly special where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus but to get there we can't let our guard down this fight is far from order from over as
