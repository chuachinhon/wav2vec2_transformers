populism is an issue in many countries many develop countries particularly and i think they can see some of the reasons for it because there is a divide between the elites and the masses of the population the population pat population feel that the system has not been fair to them they have not got their share of the efforts they have put into it that they have been left behind at least relatively and not just that it has anequal but that they are not getting the respect and the status which they feel that they deserve as citizens in the country certainly i think that sentiment is very strong in donald trump supporters you would see that the people who voted for bexe in england you would see that in the yellow vest in france in the national front our national party supporters who workefoor money thepen and you see that in other countries too i would say even in hong kong that you could described the what the demonstrators and protestors want es a kind of populacm t system not working for me lets express our unhappinesce we can spend a long time discussing what whent wrong which led to that in the other countries sor i think what in singapore we have tried very hard to do to avoid being in that position is to have a government which for very much on the basic needs of the people so we talked about housing just now how we make sure that everybody in singapore can afford to buy a house with maybe twenty five per cent of his income and between him and his wife they can afford to buy a house and have an asset we talk briefly about health care how we've got a health care system which provides good service good health services to everybody and even if you are poor there are schemes to help you and you will not be deni editale care which you need is not free is not automatic but et is available and it works we din' talk about education byt education is a very important part of it to make sure that everybodyu fields if you can make the effort if you will make the effort you can do well and you can advance in life and your family can go with you and advance in life and having graduated from school or unaversity or polytechnic that there'll be opportunities for you to continue to upbrade yourself renew your skills learn new jobs and equip yourself to cope with new demands because you graduate at the age of twenty but you may be working for fifty sixteen years after that and you need to uptaide your skills you can't read sixty years time depending on what you learned sixty years ago is not the world will have changed many times so in ways we have tried to make sure that people have basic needs met aspirations achievable and a sense that this is theirs this is their country that th they have every reason to be proud of it and they will defend the system and they'll defend ther countr and if we can do that and that they can adopt this system as this is my system it works for me there's no need for you to and vote for a team which youl pull a system down because the system is working for you whil you aunt t pull it down but it calls for high quality political leadership high quality civil service and not just competence but conviction and commitment that you believe you are doing this for a purpose which is not just to advance your own career or make your own fortune
